    <p>
     What's Up Myrtle is a front-end app and demo for the Grand Strand API Project. Starting in 2017 
     the GSAP began compiling a database of all businesses, events, and attractions for the Grand Strand 
     and beyond. This span quickly grew from the NC border out through Conway (with some in Aynor), and 
     as far south as Georgetown. For more information on this project please contact the author linked 
     below, or visit the website also listed.
